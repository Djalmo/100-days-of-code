# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Dec 28, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Did about 4 hours on freecodecamp.  

**Thoughts:** I already had some ideas on HTML and now Im getting the hang of CSS.  I dont know if I should continue on udemy or focus solely on freecode.  I registered djalmo.com and djalmo.net just for funesies.

### Day 1: Dec 29, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Started working on the tribute page project from freecodecamp.  Signed up for a couple of more sites, and github to keep track.

**Thoughts**: Struggled a bit with centering the image on the tribute page which kind of derailed me.  It had me sign up for a code website which had some options that were a bit confusing.  I'm 90% done with tribute page and have to clean it up, hopefully will do it tomorrow.

### Day 1: Dec 31, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Did some tutorials on GIT, installed Linux on laptop 

**Thoughts**: Took a small break from programming.  Gotta get back on the horse tomorrow.  Many distractions, going to have to really focus to make this work.  Think pomadoro (sp?) timers will be the way to go.
