# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Dec 28, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Did about 4 hours on freecodecamp.  

**Thoughts:** I already had some ideas on HTML and now Im getting the hang of CSS.  I dont know if I should continue on udemy or focus solely on freecode.  I registered djalmo.com and djalmo.net just for funesies.

### Day 1: Dec 29, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Started working on the tribute page project from freecodecamp.  Signed up for a couple of more sites, and github to keep track.

**Thoughts**: Struggled a bit with centering the image on the tribute page which kind of derailed me.  It had me sign up for a code website which had some options that were a bit confusing.  I'm 90% done with tribute page and have to clean it up, hopefully will do it tomorrow.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
