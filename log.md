# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Dec 28, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Did about 4 hours on freecodecamp.  

**Thoughts:** I already had some ideas on HTML and now Im getting the hang of CSS.  I dont know if I should continue on udemy or focus solely on freecode.  I registered djalmo.com and djalmo.net just for funesies.

### Day 1: Dec 29, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
